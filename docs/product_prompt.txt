I've developed an app: QRSong

It enables users to send a Spotify playlist to us. 
We will analyse the playlist, determine the release year of the songs.
We will turn it into Physical QR playing cards which can be used in games like Hitster.
Never mention the name Hitster anywhere, I don't want trouble with Jumbo. Hint it can be used as a game, but don't state which game

Users can share their own playlist, or they can select a pre-selected (by us) playlist.
We can handle playlists up to 500 cards
We ship worldwide
We accept iDeal, Apple Pay and all Major creditcards
Pricing is around 1.44 euro per 12 cards
