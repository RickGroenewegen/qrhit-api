Good day,

I'm Rick from QRSong! (https://www.qrsong.io) and we are looking for a Print & Fulfillment partner for one of our products.

What we do: 

Our service enables users to transform their Spotify playlists into QR Music cards which can be used for games & trivia. We have been selling digital versions for some time now and are looking to expand to real physical cards.

What we are looking for:

- A partner that prints, handles and ships the cards worldwide
- The cards are square. Currently they are 60x60mm but we can change that if it suits your process better
- Cards are printed on both sides
- Front side is greyscale, back side is full color
- You must have an automated way for us to send the cards to you (Rest API, or anything similar).
- We can provide the cards in any format. Currenlty we are using PDF.
- Most importantly: Each set is unique to the customer. It is their own Spotify playlist, so no set is alike.
- A set can contain 50 to 500 cards
- A plus would be if you could also provide packaging

An example PDF can be downloaded at:

The format of this PDF can be changed to your wishes if needed.

If this is something you can do: Can you provide us an explanation of your process and pricing quote?

Looking forward to your response!

Rick Groenewegen
