We just launched QRSong! 

QRSong! is a service that lets you turn your Spotify playlists into QR music cards. What makes us different? We've built a complete ecosystem around the concept!

Check us out at:

https://www.qrsong.io

What is different about our service:

• We offer a dedicated companion app for both iOS and Android:
    https://apps.apple.com/app/qrsong/id6727011939
    https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.rickgroenewegen.qrsong
• The app offers a small countdown so you have enough time to flip your phone
• The app supports all cards that support Spotify links, not just our own cards
• We offer both single-sided and double-sided PDF's
• We tidy up the song titles to keep them short (We remove stuff like '(Remastered)' etc).
• No more incorrect release years! For determining the correct release year we use 10+ online sources in combination with AI.
• If AI cannot determine the release year, all release info is hand-checked by our team 
• Still find a mistake? Let us know and you'll get a replacement PDF for free
• You will receive your order within 24 hours by e-mail
• We offer both digital and physical giftcards which you can give to your family & friends so they can purchase their own playlists.
• Both our site and app are supported in 11 different languages

Coming soon:

Real, physical cards delivered to your doorstep. We've been working on this for quite some time now and hope to offer real cards very soon!

We would love to get your feedback on this! 

Cheers
